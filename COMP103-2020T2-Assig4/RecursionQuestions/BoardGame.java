/**
 * The board game involves moving a piece on a row of squares.
 * Each square on the board has a positive integer on it.
 * The piece can move to the left or right.
 * When moving to the left, the piece must move the number of
 *  steps specified in the cell immediately to its left.
 * When moving to the right, the piece must move the number of
 *  steps specified in the cell immediately to its right.
 * For example:
 *  If the piece is currently at the cell marked P on the following board:
 *       +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
 *       | 3 | 4 | 2 | P | 3 | 1 | 5 |
 *       +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
 *  then the piece could move 2 steps to the left, or 3 steps to the right.
 *  If the piece is placed in the cell marked P on the following board:
 *       +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
 *       | 3 | 4 | 2 | 4 | 3 | P | 5 |
 *       +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
 *  then the piece can't move to the right (because 5 steps to the right would
 *  take it off the board) but it can move 3 steps to the left.
 *
 * Depending on the numbers on the board, the piece may be able to get to lots
 * of different square, or to very few squares.
 * For example (if the squares are counted from 0)
 *  In the board above, starting at square number 4, the piece could get to
 *  squares 3, 1, 6, 5, 2, but couldn't get to squares 0 or 4.

 *  In this board, starting at square number 3 (underlined)
 *       +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
 *       | 3 | 2 | 1 | 5 | 3 | 3 | 1 | 4 | 1 |
 *       +---+---+---+===+---+---+---+---+---+
 *  the piece could get to squares 3, 2, 0, 7, 8, and 6, but not 1, 4, or 5.
 *
 * You have to complete the findPlaces method to find all the squares that the piece
 * could get to from a given starting position.
 * The findPlaces method must construct and return a Set of all the indexes of the
 * squares the piece can get to (including the starting point).
 * It should not re-visit any square that it has
 * already been to because that would lead to an infinite loop!
