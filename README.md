# Comp103

Prescription:
This course focuses on the techniques for designing, building and analysing computer programs that deal with large collections of data. The course addresses techniques for programming with collections of data, and the data structures and algorithms needed to implement these collections. The course expands programming skills and provides an understanding of the principles of data abstraction, algorithm design, and the analysis of algorithms fundamental to computer science.

Course learning objectives
Students who pass this course will be able to:
•read and write programs using standard collections (sets, lists, bags, stacks, queues, priority queues, maps)
•read and write programs using linked data structures, particularly tree structures
•read and write programs using recursion
•understand ideas of algorithm complexity, do approximate analysis of simple programs with collections, and make efficient design decisions
•recognise, understand and use a selection of basic algorithms
